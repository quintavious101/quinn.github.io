Hi, Welcome!

## About Me

Hello! 

I'm currently working as a professional aide in [Dr. David Lowry's lab](https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com/) through the [GLBRC](https://www.glbrc.org/about), [KBS](https://www.kbs.msu.edu/about-kbs/), and MSU's [Plant Biology Dept](https://plantbiology.natsci.msu.edu/about-plant-biology/index.aspx).

My work in the lab mainly includes aiding in research looking at the functional genomics of *Panicum* genes and genomic resources for switchgrass. I've also helped out Dr. Phil [Robertson](https://www.kbs.msu.edu/kbs-people/faculty/g-philip-robertson/) and Dr. Jeff [Conner](https://jeffreykconner.com/)'s labs while working at KBS in sample collecting, *Arabidopsis* fitness measurements, and other rudimentary tasks. I find myself interested in a handful of macro biology paths and am narrowing down what Iâ€™d like to pursue further. Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, podcasts, sudoku puzzles, and getting outside!

I graduated last summer from Kalamazoo College with a BA in Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I also worked on K's [Composting Program](https://sustainability.kzoo.edu/composting/) through Facilities Management and the Environmental Stewardship Center, which openned opportunities like teaching the Composting PE class to 10 students several terms, manual upkeep and composting pre-consumer food waste (no fish, meat, dairy, oil) from almost every building on campus, website development (Google Sites), and creating, maintaining, and organizing the Composting shared Microsoft OneDrive.
