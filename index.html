        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>I'm currently working as a professional aide in Dr. David Lowry's lab through the GLBRC, KBS, and MSU's Plant Biology Dept.</p>
        <p>My work in the lab mainly includes aiding in research looking at the functional genomics of Panicum genes and genomic resources for switchgrass. I've also helped out Dr. Phil Robertson and Dr. Jeff Conner's labs while working at KBS in sample collecting, Arabidopsis fitness measurements, and other rudimentary tasks. I find myself interested in a handful of macro biology paths and am narrowing down what I’d like to pursue further. Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, podcasts, playing GeoGuessr, and getting outside!</p>
        <p>I graduated last summer from Kalamazoo College with a BA in Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I also worked on K's Composting Program through Facilities Management and the Environmental Stewardship Center, which openned opportunities like teaching the Composting PE class to 10 students several terms, manual upkeep and composting pre-consumer food waste (no fish, meat, dairy, oil) from almost every building on campus, website development (Google Sites), and creating, maintaining, and organizing the Composting shared Microsoft OneDrive.</p>
