        <p></p>
        <p>As stated on my home page, I'm currently working in the <a href="https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Lowry Lab</a> through the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center, Kellogg Biological Station, and Michigan State University's Plant Biology Dept.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My work in the lab mainly includes aiding in research looking at the functional genomics of <i>Panicum</i> genes and genomic resources for switchgrass. This manifests as using both a Wiley Knife mill and Cyclone mill to refine dried whole <i>Panicum halli</i> into a dust for further biochemical analysis, and in the spring through to the fall my work also includes maintaining and harvesting the GWAS (Genome-Wide Associated Study) switchgrass (<i>Panicum virgatum</i>) plots.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I also have completely transcribed handwritten data and entered that into a spreadsheet. These data were taken from 2022 by a previous Lowry lab post doctoral fellow researching the comparison of herbivory on coastal vs. in-land yellow monkey flowers (<i>Erythranthe guttata</i>, previously <i>Mimulus guttatus</i>) in California.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>During my time in the Lowry lab, I've also helped out other KBS labs including Dr. Phil <a href="https://www.kbs.msu.edu/kbs-people/faculty/g-philip-robertson/" target="_blank">Robertson</a> and Dr. Jeff <a href="https://jeffreykconner.com/" target="_blank">Conner</a>'s labs in sample collecting, thale cress (<i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>) fitness measurements, and other rudimentary tasks. As well as Dr. Chris Blackwood's lab in collecting soil core samples. I'm currently helping in the Conner lab and have been working in Jeff's lab for roughly 5 months.</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>I find myself interested in a handful of macro biology paths, (particularly in the intersection between biology and computer science) and am narrowing down what I’d like to pursue further, with a potential of graduate school on the horizon. Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, podcasts, spending time with my friends, and getting outside!</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>My Undergraduate Experience</h3>
        <p>I graduated last summer from Kalamazoo College with a BA in Biology and a minor in Computer Science. Within the Biology Department, I conducted a senior project where I made a field guide of a forested area on K's campus and wrote a partnered literature review on restoring woodland areas in collaboration with Indigenous communities. I also had a biostatistics-heavy apprenticeship working with data collected from the Lillian Anderson Arboretum in R and R Studio. Throughout my time at K, I was a teacher's assistant and grader for various classes including Ecology and Conservation (BIOL 224) and Computer Organization (COMP 315) for several terms. While completing my minor in Computer Science, I have learned to code in many languages, and am confident in my abilites to adapt to new and/or old programming languages whether I've written in the language or not. I also worked on K's <a href="https://sustainability.kzoo.edu/composting/" target="_blank">Composting Program</a> through Facilities Management and the Environmental Stewardship Center, which opened opportunities like teaching the Composting PE class to 10 students several terms, manual upkeep and composting pre-consumer food waste (no fish, meat, dairy, oil) from almost every building on campus, website development (Google Sites), and creating, maintaining, and organizing the Composting shared Microsoft OneDrive.</p>
