        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>As stated on my home page, I'm currently working in the <a href="https://davidbryantlowry.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Lowry Lab</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>My work in the lab mainly includes aiding in research looking at the functional genomics of <i>Panicum</i> genes and genomic resources for switchgrass. This manifests current as using both a Wiley Knife mill and Cyclone mill to refine dried whole <i>Panicum halli</i> into a dust for further biochemical analysis, but in the spring/fall also maintaining and harvesting the GWAS switchgrass plots.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>During my time in the Lowry lab, I've also helped out other KBS labs including Dr. Phil <a href="https://www.kbs.msu.edu/kbs-people/faculty/g-philip-robertson/" target="_blank">Robertson</a> and Dr. Jeff <a href="https://jeffreykconner.com/" target="_blank">Conner</a>'s labs in sample collecting, <i>Arabidopsis</i> fitness measurements, and other rudimentary tasks.</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>I graduated last summer from Kalamazoo College with a BA in Biology and a minor in Computer Science. I also worked on K's <a href="https://sustainability.kzoo.edu/composting/" target="_blank">Composting Program</a> through Facilities Management and the Environmental Stewardship Center, which openned opportunities like teaching the Composting PE class to 10 students several terms, manual upkeep and composting pre-consumer food waste (no fish, meat, dairy, oil) from almost every building on campus, website development (Google Sites), and creating, maintaining, and organizing the Composting shared Microsoft OneDrive.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I find myself interested in a handful of macro biology paths and am narrowing down what I’d like to pursue further. Outside of the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, podcasts, sudoku puzzles, and getting outside!</p>
