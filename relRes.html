        <h2>Kellogg Biological Station</h2>
        <p>As mentioned in my About page, I've been working on Dr. David Lowry's GWAS switchgrass project: <i>Systems Biology and Adaptation in Switchgrass: Discovering Mechanisms Underlying Plant-Microbe-Soil Interactions and Abiotic Stress Tolerance.</i> Alongside this, I've also helped enter data for a yellow monkey flower project looking at herbivory differences between populations of monkey flower from inland annual and coastal prennial individuals that either are or are not in exclosures from 2022. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Outside of the Lowry lab, I've also been helping the Dr. Jeffery Conner's lab for the past 5 months. I aided in a chamber common garden experiment, looking at populations of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> from various places around the globe and generally looking for any trends between stamen count and any other measures of fitness or growth including pedicel, seed, and fruit count, among other measures. I am now working on rosette measurements of <i>Arabidopsis</i> on ImageJ as another measure of fitness as the measurement may be indicative of winter survivability. During my time in the lab, I was able to work with members of the lab that were working on other aspects of the stamen loss project including the 2025 summer undergraduate researchers Scarlett and Natalie.</p>

        <h3>Population and Community Ecology: Computing and visualizing the correlation between tree ring size and weather station data in the Lillian Anderson Arboretum, Kalamazoo MI.</h3>

        <p> Variation in tree ring size can be influenced by different environmental factors, including those measured by the weather station in the Lillian Anderson Arboretum. This station, connected to the Enviro-weather Automated Weather Station Network through Michigan State, has been collecting weather data such as rainfall and temperature for the past 11 years. Our goal was to characterize the relationship between the nearby sassafras tree ring sizes and the weather station data. After collecting slices of the trees, measuring tree ring sizes under a microscope, and running tests in R, the strongest correlation, between annual rainfall and tree ring size, was quantified and visualized. This research was conducted on sassafras trees found in the Lillian Anderson Arboretum.</p>

        <h3>Biology Apprenticeship: Interplay of avian predation and parasitism in goldenrod gall communities in SW Michigan.</h3>

        <p>Goldenrod (<i>Solidago spp.</i>) galls, formed by goldenrod gall fly larvae, create unique bulbs on stems, serving as microhabitats for larvae and attracting a variety of predators and parasitoids, such as parasitic wasps (<i>Eurytoma gigantea</i>), beetles (<i>Mordellistena unicolor</i>), downy woodpeckers (<i>Picoides pubescens</i>), and black-capped chickadees (<i>Poecile atricapillus</i>). This study examined the complex relationships between these gall-forming insects, their predators, and parasitoids to understand community dynamics and trophic interactions within the goldenrod gall ecosystem. Galls were collected from either a larger and smaller site, observed, and measured. Then using R, we performed linear modeling on probabilities of predation, parasitism, and gall fly emergence, to examine any site-specific, size, and/or predator differences. This research was conducted on goldenrod galls found in the Lillian Anderson Arboretum in Kalamazoo MI.</p>

        <h3>Senior Integrated Project: A Field Guide of the Grove at Kalamazoo College + Literature Review: Exploring ways to restore a woodland habitat and its native inhabitants while embracing Indigenous knowledge.</h3> 

        <p>The purpose of this project was to collect an observational record of the plant and animal life in the Grove on Kalamazoo College's campus during the summer. The Grove at Kalamazoo provides the campus with a beautiful green space that is the main site of the Composting Program at Kalamazoo College but is welcome to all of the Kalamazoo campus community. I spent the summer of 2023 working in the Grove taking photographs or sound recordings of the plants, animals, and fungi present in the Grove at the time. The literature review paper focused on ways that a woodland habitat could be restored and more specifically in a manner that embraces Indigenous knowledge and management techniques. A woodland habitat such as the Grove along with the various critters within it can benefit greatly from that area being restored. The review highlights the advantages of restoring a woodland area in ways that open professional communication between Indigenous communities and academic researchers. Not to mention, the review also features various techniques utilized by Indigenous communities emphasizing Indigenous land knowledge.</p>
