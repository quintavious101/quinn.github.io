        <p>As mentioned in my About page, I've been working on Dr. David Lowry's GWAS switchgrass project: <i>Systems Biology and Adaptation in Switchgrass: Discovering Mechanisms Underlying Plant-Microbe-Soil Interactions and Abiotic Stress Tolerance.</i> Alongside this, I've also helped enter data for a yellow monkey flower project looking at herbivory differences between populations of monkey flower from inland annual and coastal prennial individuals that either are or are not in exclosures from 2022. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Outside of the Lowry lab, I've also been helping the Dr. Jeffery Conner's lab for the past 5 months, aiding in a chamber common garden experiment, looking at populations of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> from various places around the globe and generally looking for any trends between stamen count and any other measures of fitness or growth. Shout out Scarlett. As well as measuring rosettes of <i>Arabidopsis</i> on ImageJ to see how big the rosettes are...</p>
